          <div class="entry">
            <p>When I started blogging, I was afraid this would happen: that I would stop after a few posts. I try to only blog when I&#8217;d like to present something. However, the moment has come to write again: this time I&#8217;d like to show you some photographs taken with a Canon A-1, an old analog camera.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-300x200.jpg" alt="" title="Scan" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-497" /></a></p>

<p>This first picture has been taken at my parents&#8217; home. I used a star filter, which doesn&#8217;t really show, except for the reflection in the window. But this filter also gives the entire picture a soft look. Sometimes they have a dog at home, when friends are on vacation. In this picture, Niño can (barely) be seen laying in the shadow. This picture really shows the peaceful atmosphere that&#8217;s there.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-1.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-498" /></a></p>
<p>I like this picture because it shows a typical state of my desk. I&#8217;ve used a bit of overexposure, so that the notebook is shown correctly, and everything else is brighter, which looks quite interesting!</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-2.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-2-300x208.jpg" width="300" height="208" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-499" /></a></p>
<p>This one is the coolest picture I&#8217;ve taken so far! Using only a briefcase to support the camera, and an extended shutter button, the timing here is remarkable. A few cars that were very similar approached me, so there is only one very bright line visible. I was also very lucky there was no traffic in the other direction, because now the background is very dark, which is in great contrast with the line. If there was traffic in the other direction, their headlights would&#8217;ve enlightened the background. The fact that it rains adds to the atmosphere by having great reflections on the ground.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-3.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-3-300x208.jpg" width="300" height="208" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-500" /></a></p>
<p>This is a simple photograph of my friend Hans, but I really liked the colour contrast. He has a nice expression on his face, and the background is just right. Simply a decent picture.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-4.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-4-300x207.jpg" width="300" height="207" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-501" /></a></p>
<p>This one has, again, been taken at my parents&#8217; home, and I like the natural chaos that is displayed. A Harry Potter book on the table, some pillows missing or not straightened, the shadows falling in a weird way. It&#8217;s just how things are, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-5.jpg" class="lightbox"<img src="http://janpaulposma.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-5-300x208.jpg" width="300" height="208" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-502" /></a></p>
<p>This is an interesting one, because it took a while to get it right. I noticed this bike before my house, and immediately thought about photographing it. The problem is, there are only a few moments each year, in the summer, when the sun is actually in the right position. I had to wait a few weeks, and when the moment was there, I took a few shots. Luckily it was a beautiful day, and the rusted bike with the grass growing through it, in combination with the awesome perspective, makes this one of my favourite pictures so far.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-6.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-6-300x208.jpg" width="300" height="208" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-503" /></a></p>
<p>Because of the weird angle my dad&#8217;s lower leg is making, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure whether to publish this picture. Still, nothing can be totally perfect, and while this is one has great timing, a great expression and good lightning, the imperfections are what make it worthwhile to look at. The ball is mid-air, almost impossible to spot against the white background.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-7.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-7-300x207.jpg" width="300" height="207" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-504" /></a></p>
<p>You might see a pattern of organised chaos emerging, and maybe that is the case. But I like this one most because it reminds me of the cool times at <a href="a-little-about-science-center-noord.html">SCN</a>. Experimenting with electronics is inherently chaotic.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-8.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-8-218x300.jpg" width="218" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-505" /></a></p>
<p>When I was in Washington, D.C. for a conference, I took many pictures at night while touring the city. Most of them were miserable failures, but this one was unexpectedly great. This is one of the few pictures that looks way better in real life, as it was impossible to scan the moon properly.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-9.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-9-300x211.jpg" width="300" height="211" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-506" /></a></p>
<p>A classic airport picture: I couldn&#8217;t let the moment pass! The huge amount of air and clouds in this photograph adds to a sense of space, which in this case I&#8217;d argue to be a good thing.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-10.jpg" class="lightbox"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Scan-10-300x211.jpg" width="300" height="211" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-507" /></a></p>
<p>Decorating the Christmas tree! This one has been taken with a star filter, and with a shutter time of several seconds.</p>
