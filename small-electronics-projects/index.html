      <h1>Small electronics projects</h1>
    </header>

    <p>In my teens I worked on various electronics projects, with the support of volunteers at technical youth centres in my city, <a href="http://www.djog.nl/">De Jonge Onderzoekers</a> and <a href="http://stichting-scn.nl/">SCN</a>. A lot of it is lost, but I&rsquo;ve tried to gather pictures, schematics, and code, from old backups.</p>

    <p><strong>Various standard projects</strong></p>

    <p>We had a bunch of projects for kids to get started. I&rsquo;ve made some of these as a kid myself, and I later compiled them into a <a href="scn-booklet.pdf">PDF</a>. I&rsquo;ve probably helped make several dozen of these.</p>

    <p><strong>Mobile Phone Sniffer</strong></p>

    <p>This is a project from the <a href="https://www.elektormagazine.com/magazine/elektor-200205">May 2002 Elektor</a>. It allowed you to hear where there are mobile phones in use, using headphones.</p>

    <p><strong>Mailbox Counter</strong></p>

    <p>This device was hooked up to my parents&rsquo; mailbox, using two wires that would touch each other in rest, but become disconnected when mail was thrown in. On the print board it had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-segment_display">nine-segment display</a> that would show the number of times mail was thrown in, and a button to reset the counter. It was completely taped in and put inside plastic so it would survive rain.</p>

    <p>It worked for a few days until people started telling my parents they saw a bomb on our mailbox, and I had to take it down.</p>

    <p><strong>Rotating ticker</strong></p>

    <p>I based this project off the design that a <a href="http://schreuderelectronics.com/">friend</a> made. The idea is to have 8 LEDs quickly spin through the air, and then blink them in a particular pattern, so you see words appear in the air. I built a robust base from wood, and a circuit board that rotates on top of it, with another circuit board with the LEDs mounted at an right angle onto it. The full-colour two-sided bike wheel version of this was a <a href="/pimpmybike-biking-at-night-with-style">natural next step</a>.</p>

    <p>This animated GIF is the only picture I have left of it. The thing has mysteriously disappeared.</p>

    <p><strong>PIC Programmer</strong></p>

    <p>The microcontroller I used most often was the <a href="http://www.microchip.com/pic">PIC</a>. I built a test board, programmer, and serial port interface for it.</p>

    <p><strong>A bunch of my gear (photo from 2009)</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Other projects</strong></p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s some oscilloscope games that we made, based on <a href="https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/resurrecting-tennis-for-two-a-video-game-from-1958/">this design</a>:</p>

    <p>I also helped some other folks build stuff, like aquarium lights and an alarm clock that would play old game tunes:</p>
