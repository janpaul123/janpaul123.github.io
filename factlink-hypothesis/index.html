    <p><b>A:</b> Factlink and Hypothes.is both have an ambitious mission to improve the quality of information we consume each day, in order to make the world a better place. I&rsquo;ll try to make an unbiased comparison (disclaimer: I work at Factlink).</p>

    <p>Hypothes.is is currently building a platform on which anything on the web can be discussed, by making an annotation, commenting on that annotation, and so on. They focus on making these annotations work for a lot of different types of content, and for different use cases. On top of this Hypothes.is is planning to have a reputation system in order to improve quality of content.</p>

    <p>Factlink is focused on determining the credibility of information on the web. The idea is to have statements ("The earth is flat.") which can be supported or weakened by other statements ("No-one has ever fallen off the earth!"). Such statements are typically annotations from all over the web. Using these arguments, Factlink tries to determine the credibility of a statement. When new information becomes available, it can influence many other statements. Focusing on statements also means it easily scales across different websites, as it can potentially show the credibility of "The earth is flat." in many different places.</p>

    <p>We aim to open up our platform and dataset in the future, and we&rsquo;re still debating how we can best do this. For now, our focus is to make the product work well!</p>

    <p><b>In short, Hypothes.is facilitates open-ended discussion anywhere on the web, while Factlink shows credibility of statements, arguments, and users.</b></p>

    <p>It's great to see different initiatives with similar goals (many more besides these two!) &mdash; to significantly improve public debate and curb some of the misinformation out there. These are exciting times.</p>
