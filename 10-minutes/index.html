  <title>Moving data in 10 minutes</title>

      <h1>Moving data in 10 minutes</h1>
      <em><time pubdate>May 2017</time>; list at the bottom regularly updated</em>
    </header>

    <p>
      Data needs to move. Those backup hard drives sitting in the closet? They have quite a few bits fallen over already. Or they may <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html">not work at all</a>, next time I use them. And that is digital, binary data&mdash;let's not even think about those photo albums in my grandma's basement, which "we are going to digitise soon."
    </p>

    <p>
      And what about link rot? The stories on this website were only written a few years ago, and yet when I ran an <a href="http://www.brokenlinkcheck.com">analysis</a><sup>1</sup>, many links didn't work any more. The world moves, and data needs to move with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But at least those hard drives and photo albums are my own responsibility. What worries me more is the trust we place in institutions. Merely 10 years ago I used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyves">social network</a> that I never thought would simply vanish.<sup>2</sup> From photo albums to VHS to DVD to MKV. From tapes, to zip drives, to SSD, to the cloud. From IRC to MSN to Facebook to Ello<sup>3</sup>. <strong>Data needs to move.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em><sup>1</sup> This link will probably be broken within a few years‚Ä¶</em><br>
      <em><sup>2</sup> Thanks to the heroic efforts of the <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Hyves">Archive Team</a>, I was able to retrieve some of my data.</em><br>
      <em><sup>3</sup> Just kidding.</em>

      Now, most of my data can be moved around easily, with several backups in different locations. But I realised that the data that I entrusted some institutions with&mdash;Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and more&mdash;can not be easily moved. Therefore I set a goal for myself:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      For any system that I use, I should be able to move my data to another system within 10 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The time constraint is important. With sufficient effort one can move data out of any system, but one shouldn't need to. Also, ideally it would be done automatically, so I can create a backup script that periodically copies my data from various systems.
    </p>

    <p>I realised that for a lot of systems that I use, this isn't true yet, so I set out to make it so. This page trackers my efforts so far, and I hope to include other relevant projects here as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, for once, we have a major force on our side: the European Union. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf">General Data Protection Regulation</a> Article 20, which will go into effect on 25 May 2018, requires service providers to provide users' data "in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format." Hopefully this legislation will speed up the efforts described on this page.

    <p>Here's an overview of the services that I actively backup my data from. Some methods are more technical than others. For the technically inclined I've included some script snippets, which I actually use (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell">zsh</a>, though they should typically also work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell">sh</a>). I'll update this list when I discover new methods.</p>

            Their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467">archive tool</a> exports a lot, but not the most important thing: my likes and comments.

            Their <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160">archive tool</a> is pretty good: it exports tweets, retweets, pictures, all with links to the originals. It does link to its URL shortener (which is <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=URLTeam">problematic</a>), but has the original URL in the HTML <em>title</em> attribute. üëè Unfortunately it doesn't export direct messages, and there doesn't seem to be a way to automate exporting an archive.

            I want to backup the videos that I watched, but their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms">Terms of Service</a> don't allow that. However, if I would want to (I would never do this Youtube, don't sue me), I could use <a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a> pretty easily, for example like this: <code>youtube-dl --write-info-json --write-description --write-thumbnail --write-annotations --all-subs --ignore-errors --output "%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s" &lt;my-liked-video-playlist-url&gt;</code>.

            They provide <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201658943-Export-your-team-s-Slack-history">exports</a> for admins, but unfortunately not for regular users. I also want to backup my private conversations, which their exports typically don't provide. They do provide an API which we can use to create a backup. For this you can use <a href="https://github.com/jesusmb1995/SlackBackup">SlackBackup</a>, which is easy to setup. I fixed some bugs in that script, and my fixed version can be found <a href="SlackBackup_JP.jar">here</a> (they have also merged it into their repo, but just not cut a release yet). Use it like this: <code>java -jar SlackBackup_JP.jar &lt;your-token&gt; cgpf</code>

            E-mail is a super-portable format, and Google Mail is no exception. Besides being able to (incrementally) make a copy using <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229">IMAP</a> or <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6089246">POP</a>, they also provide an archive tool through <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout">Google Takeout</a>. If that is not enough, you can use <a href="http://gmvault.org/">Gmvault</a>, which claims to smooth over some bugs in Google's APIs (that is what I use).

            Super easy.

      One interesting question is where to store the data. I've thought about several options, and for now settled on something simple: multiple external hard drives (mirrors with the same data), plus Dropbox for the most important stuff. As my friend <a href="https://jbeekman.nl/">Jethro</a> said, you need at least 3 hard drives: one will fail, then the second one might also fail as you copy data off it, and then you'll be happy to have a third one!
    </p>

    <p>
      I've also considered cloud storage, but it's not very attractive. For example, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">Amazon S3</a> costs $0.023 per GB per month, but I can buy a 5TB external hard drive for $120 (in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Backup-Desktop-External-STDT5000100/dp/B00J0O5R2I">May 2017</a>), which is $0.024 per GB. That means I can buy one external hard drive per month for the same price! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/">Amazon Glacier</a> and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a> seem a lot cheaper, so I might use those for last-resort backups.
