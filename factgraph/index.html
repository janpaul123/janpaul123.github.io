  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right"><span class="factlink" data-factid="13827">Factlink started with a mission to annotate the world’s information, and to provide a platform in which credible information can surface. We called the second part the “Fact Graph”: the interfaces for linking pieces of text on the web together, and a calculation that shows for each piece of text how credible it is.</span></p>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">For the last six months, we haven’t focused on the Fact Graph, as we wanted to get annotation right first. But today, we’re sharing the insights from the hundreds of hours of research into the Fact Graph. We look at our collaborative “fact checking” system in detail, especially the mathematics and user interfaces.</p>

  <h4>Factlink’s original idea</h4>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">What did we try to do anyway? In an internal document we wrote (emphasis added):</p>

  <blockquote>“The goal of Factlink is to solve the problem of assigning credibility to sources. The traditional mental model of a few authoritative sources, such as investigative journalism and peer reviewed science, falls short in a world with billions of tweets and blogs. And, finding correct information simply based on text search and popularity does not seem to be a sustainable trend. Factlink tries to solve this fundamentally hard problem by <b>assigning scores</b> to <b>strings of text annotated by its users</b>.”</blockquote>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">In short, we tried to show if what you’re reading is true or not.</p>


  <h4>Annotation</h4>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">We started out with annotating sentences on websites. After installing a browser extension, you could select a piece of text on any website, and create an annotation. We called these annotations “Factlinks”. It worked like this:</p>

Others who subscribed to that channel, <span class="factlink" data-factid="13555">such as experts or interested people</span>, would see the Factlink on their activity feed. They could then give their opinion, add sources, and comment on the Factlink.</p>

    <li><span class="factlink" data-factid="13828">The number inside the Factwheel represented the amount of "thinking" people have put in to get at this number. The higher this number, the more reliable the credibility calculation.</span></li>

  <h4>Calculating credibility</h4>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">How can we use these votes and evidence to get to a summary of how credible a Factlink is? For this, we first introduce some math. We define a <em>credibility tuple</em> to be a tuple of three numbers: &lt;<em>true</em>, <em>false</em>, <em>unsure</em>&gt;, or &lt;<em>t</em>, <em>f</em>, <em>u</em>&gt;. These numbers represent how <span class="blog-fact-graph-agree">true</span>, how <span class="blog-fact-graph-disagree">false</span>, or how <span class="blog-fact-graph-unsure">unsure</span> a Factlink is. The size of each number represents how much “work” or “thinking” <span class="factlink" data-factid="13824">has gone into reaching this conclusion. For now, let’s just say it’s the number of votes.</span></p>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">We denote the credibility tuple of a <span class="blog-fact-graph-f1">Factlink F1</span> as <em>c</em>(<span class="blog-fact-graph-f1">F1</span>). The numbers <em>t</em>, <em>f</em>, and <em>u</em> correspond to green, red, and blue parts of the Factwheel. The number inside the Factwheel is the sum of those numbers, representing the total amount of votes, or the amount of “thinking” people have put in. For example:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>c</em>(<span class="blog-fact-graph-factlink">“Generally agreed upon Factlink”</span>) = <span class="blog-fact-graph-agree">&lt;10000, 8, 13&gt;</span><br>

    <em>c</em>(<span class="blog-fact-graph-factlink">“Factlink without any votes”</span>) = <span class="blog-fact-graph-unsure">&lt;0, 0, 0&gt;</span><br>
    <em>c</em>(<span class="blog-fact-graph-factlink">“Highly controversial Factlink”</span>) = <span class="blog-fact-graph-undetermined blog-fact-graph-7839-8009-3041">&lt;7839, 8009, 3041&gt;</span><br>

An “agree” vote corresponds to <span class="blog-fact-graph-agree">&lt;1, 0, 0&gt;</span>, a “disagree” vote to <span class="blog-fact-graph-disagree">&lt;0, 1, 0&gt;</span> and an “unsure” vote to <span class="blog-fact-graph-unsure">&lt;0, 0, 1&gt;</span>.</p>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">For example, if you have <span class="blog-fact-graph-supporting"><i class="icon-plus-circled"></i> supporting evidence</span>, that a lot of people find relevant, and a lot of people think is true, then that could count as a big vote in favour of the Factlink, say <span class="blog-fact-graph-agree">&lt;300, 0, 0&gt;</span>. Such evidence would weigh the same as 300 people voting in favour, so there must be a darn good reason why it weighs so much. In our model there must be 300 people <span class="blog-fact-graph-agree">agreeing</span> with the <span class="blog-fact-graph-supporting"><i class="icon-plus-circled"></i> supporting Factlink</span>, and 300 people saying that the relation is <span class="blog-fact-graph-agree">relevant</span>.

  <h4>Variations</h4>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">We’ve had various variations on this calculation, which might be worth mentioning. For example, you could add evidence for the uncertainty of a Factlink, which would add to the number of unsure votes.</p>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">The most notable addition was authority. You could gain authority when people found your evidence <span class="blog-fact-graph-agree">relevant</span>. This encouraged making good connections between Factlinks. We didn’t award authority if someone agreed with a Factlink you annotated, as you shouldn’t be punished for not posting agreeable content. After all, the whole point was to call out misinformation on the web.</p>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">Authority was then used to weigh votes. The votes of people with high authority would weigh more than the votes of people with low authority. This way we tried to build moderation into the system: if people appreciated the evidence you posted, then your vote would weigh more than that of people who weren’t yet appreciated by the community.</p>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">Of course, people who have expertise on one topic don’t necessarily know much about other topics. That’s why at one point we even had topic-specific authority, weighed by “topic channels” that people posted Factlinks to. But that’s another story.</p>

  <h4>User interface</h4>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">The calculation had been designed to be directly visualised and interacted with. But building a good user interface proved tricky. We started out with tabs for supporting and weakening evidence. But that meant that the initially opened tab got the most attention, an undesirable bias.</p>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">More importantly, there were too many numbers on the screen, which was overwhelming to many users. It also wasn’t clear what all the different numbers meant. We tried to address those problems with a design that showed all votes and evidence in one overview:</p>

All the numbers in the middle add up to the big number on top, which represents the “total amount of thinking” or “brain cycles” that people have put into it.</p>

If you click upvote, you want the number to go up. Just adding an agreeing vote to the relevance of the evidence is not enough, as you often also need to agree with the underlying Factlink. Therefore we added popups when clicking on an upvote or downvote button, to ask what you think exactly:</span></p>

  <h4>Epilogue</h4>

  <p class="factlink-tether-target factlink-tether-enabled factlink-tether-element-attached-top factlink-tether-element-attached-left factlink-tether-target-attached-top factlink-tether-target-attached-right">In the end, we didn’t gain enough traction with this part of Factlink, and decided to focus on annotation. But we think the idea was quite intriguing. We hope that someday online communities can visibly work together to assess the credibility of statements using evidence. To curb misinformation. We hope to have inspired you.</p>
