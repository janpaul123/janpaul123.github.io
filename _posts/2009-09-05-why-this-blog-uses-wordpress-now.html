<p><a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a> is a pretty good idea. You just send an e-mail with your blog text, some photos, video and sound, and they&#8217;ll automatically make a nice blog for you, all for free. The photo gallery is also pretty nice.</p>
<p>They even upload your photos to <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com">Picasa</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, etc., and put your video on <a href="http://youtube.com">Youtube</a> and other video services. They also send notifications on <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, and other microblogging sites, and even on social network sites and other blogs. They have an <a href="http://posterous.com/help/autopost">extended list</a> of all the sites they support auto-posting to.</p>
<p>They also support custom domain names, <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="http://feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>, a <a href="http://posterous.com/help/bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> and a nice <a href="http://posterous.com/help/waystoshare">Share on Posterous</a> button. It&#8217;s simply amazing.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, the limitations of Posterous quickly became obvious to me. No options whatsoever to customize the design and the media options are pretty limited. </p>

<p>An example: for my next blog post I want to be able to embed multiple small galleries on different places in the post, as it&#8217;s quite a long read. There are no upload facilities on the site, so I just e-mailed all the photos using multiple e-mails for the different galleries. Now I copied the gallery code from the different posts that were generated to the &#8216;main&#8217; post. It looks something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>[[posterous-content:XfwIQTnahWsSQOSZUGMi]]</p></blockquote>
<p>Thinking that the photo access would be limited to the user account, I thought it was a nice way to add multiple galleries to one post. Wrong: the access to photos is limited to the same post. Still, why use such a complex code with a hash; if the photos are limited to the post, why not use something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>[[ gallery ]]</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s an upcoming feature, maybe it already exists but hidden somewhere (like those crazy tag options in the subject field).. </p>
<p>Anyroad, WordPress works excellent, it&#8217;s a really sound system, and very easy to setup. I&#8217;m also quite happy with this minimalistic theme.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Posterous is a fine system for people who ..</p>
<ol>
<li> .. don&#8217;t understand much of blogging and just want to type some nice stories, optionally with pictures. Useful for the average non-tech person who barely understands e-mail.
<li> .. want to be able to write a nice photo- or videoblog, very easy to add photos from vacation or a mobile device, just by mailing them. Your various social accounts will be updated too, very nice.
<li> .. don&#8217;t have the time updating the status of all their 10+ social, microblogging and blog accounts and want one nice interface to add things to all of them. Finding out what went wrong with their lives would be a great idea for these people as well.
