title: Last day of school, in 2008
---
<p>On the last day of the school year it is common practice in the Netherlands that the building is transformed by the graduate students. There is a theme that has been kept secret for months, and an afternoon show to amuse the fellow students and teachers, usually with some pranks on the latter. </p>

<p>In 2008 our class graduated, and we decided to hold a hippie festival. Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t as popular as Woodstock about forty years earlier, but still it was totally awesome! A few weeks ago I found all the video material of that day and decided to make a compilation. The first video is about the morning, giving an impression of the great atmosphere in the school. The second video is the show, which is entirely in Dutch.</p>
