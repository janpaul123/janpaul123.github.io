      <h1>My very first website</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve dug up a very old website (Feb 2002) of mine. It was clearly an early backup since there was almost no content. I made it using Microsoft Frontpage, which I can indeed vaguely remember. I also found a WS_FTP.LOG file with a single line: <code>2002.02.27 16:17 B D:\Mijn documenten\JP\index.html --> home.hccnet.nl / index.html</code>. I tried finding it on the Internet Archive, but I could only find a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030903222537/http://home.hccnet.nl/jp.posma/">slightly later crawl</a>, in which this website had been removed.</p>

    <p>I also found this amazing GIF, probably made by my younger brother Rene (because of the filename; &ldquo;visrene.gif&rdquo;, translated: &ldquo;fish Rene&rdquo;):</p>
